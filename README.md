DSI Capstone Project for Fantasy Football Predictions

Fantasy Football Projections: ​ Are ESPN’s fantasy football projections accurate? Which site has
the best fantasy football projections?

Fantasy football is a huge part of sports in the United States, and help casual fans understand
and become more involved in a sport that they previously didn't feel fully invested in. We base
our starting lineups based on the projections that were given to us by various fantasy football
sites, however from week to week there are always projections that fall short and end up
affecting our chances of winning negatively. This project is an attempt to figure out whether or
not ESPN gives accurate enough fantasy projections as well as seeing which site among
various fantasy football sites provides the most accurate projections.

Data: 

At first, I would being to look at relative and absolute error between what the projection for the
player is and what the actual value of their fantasy points ended up being. I would test for
statistical significance to measure whether or not there is bias within these projections or not.
For example, when looking at various projections we can see someone like Matt Forte is
projected to score 20 points while Ka’Deem Carey (Forte’s backup) was projected to score one
point. If Forte scores 19 points and Carey scores zero, both players have an absolute error of
one point. However, one could argue that the near-miss on Forte’s total is more impressive. We
could also use relative error to measure the amount of biases in these projections.
